Branches: _master_ is the current working version,
_edition3_ is edition 3, only minor changes/fixes will happen in that branch.

* scv.tex is the LaTeX file
* notations.tex is the list of notations
* Figures are in figures/
* publish.sh compiles the file to pdf (probably overdoing it, but that doesn't hurt)
* getstats.sh counts the numbers of sections, exercises, figures, etc.
* resizepdftocrownquatro.sh resizes a pdf to Crown Quatro size which is what the printed version on lulu is using
