An introduction to the field of Several Complex Variables, a course for graduate students after one semester of standard complex analysis in one variable. This book is a polished version of my course notes for Math 6283, Several Complex Variables, at Oklahoma State University.

Table of contents:
Introduction
1. Holomorphic functions in several variables
2. Convexity and pseudoconvexity
3. CR functions
4. The dbar-problem
5. Integral kernels
6. Complex analytic varieties
