Perhaps:

 * In the one-variable stuff, perhaps do winding numbers.

So current plan for new SCV bits:

 * the d-bar in polydiscs theorem (already started)
 * Mention cousin problems, probably earlier.  Don't know how far to go in
   that direction.  Seems to make sense in the dbar chapter.

Some more uncategorized bits:

From Richard Lärkäng / Elizabeth Wulcan:

Maybe I could also mention something about what we used from other sources, which are topics you might consider adding something about (although I suppose you try to keep the text rather short and have already made choices of your favourite topics):
* When discussing holomorphic convexity, we looked at a sketch of a proof that holo convexity is equivalent to being able to interpolate on any discrete sequence of distinct points, based on the proof in for example Demailly, see the end of https://canvas.gu.se/courses/35064/files/2891526/download?wrap=1.
* The last week we also discussed solvability of the dbar-equation on polydiscs, based on the proof in for example Griffiths-Harris, see https://canvas.gu.se/courses/35064/files/2944759/download?wrap=1
* We ended the course by discussing how solvability of dbar implies the possibility of extending holomorphic functions from affine complex subspaces, which in turn implies being a domain of holomorphy, mainly based on the proof in Hörmander, see https://canvas.gu.se/courses/35064/files/2956527/download?wrap=1).
* Elizabeth also discussed something about Cousin I problems and its relation solvability of dbar for (0,1)-forms, based on the lecture notes of Korevaar and Wiegerinck, see https://canvas.gu.se/courses/35064/files/2977941/download?wrap=1.
* The treatment of (sub)harmonic functions in C was a bit too brief for our students, since most had hardly seen anything of that theory before, so we included many of the proofs that you left as exercises.
