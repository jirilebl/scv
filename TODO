Minor things:

* The back cover text line splitting is weird, try to fix for next time, not a big
  issue, but looks a bit weird.

Some major maybe things for next big version:

* A very short history section at the end of each chapter/section with the
  proper references.

Some more uncategorized bits:

Some remaining maybes from Richard Lärkäng / Elizabeth Wulcan (by now, lot has been added):

* When discussing holomorphic convexity, we looked at a sketch of a proof that holo convexity is equivalent to being able to interpolate on any discrete sequence of distinct points, based on the proof in for example Demailly, see the end of https://canvas.gu.se/courses/35064/files/2891526/download?wrap=1.
