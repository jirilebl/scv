Minor changes from suggestions by Richard L채rk채ng:
  * In 2.4 and onwards, don't use f for harminic/subharmonic functions but
    rather use a different letter like u.  Downside is that U is used for
    the domain often and makes things a bit funky to say in lecture.
    Not sure about this.  I see upsides and downsides.
  * Proposition 2.4.3 should really have the "local" version perhaps, though
    it really follows from 2.4.5, no?

Minor things:

* The back cover text line splitting is weird, try to fix for next time, not a big
issue, but looks a bit weird.

So current plan for new SCV bits:

* Nothing right now

Some more uncategorized bits:

Some remaining maybes from Richard L채rk채ng / Elizabeth Wulcan (by now, lot has been added):

* When discussing holomorphic convexity, we looked at a sketch of a proof that holo convexity is equivalent to being able to interpolate on any discrete sequence of distinct points, based on the proof in for example Demailly, see the end of https://canvas.gu.se/courses/35064/files/2891526/download?wrap=1.
* The treatment of (sub)harmonic functions in C was a bit too brief for our students, since most had hardly seen anything of that theory before, so we included many of the proofs that you left as exercises.
