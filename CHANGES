Since edition 3

Larger changes in general:

<li> New section 4.4 on the solvability of the d-bar problem in the polydisc.
<li> New section 4.5 on the extension from an affine subspace and its relation
to being a domain of holomorphy as an application of the \(\bar{\partial}\)-problem.
<li> New section 4.6 on Cousin problems.
<li> New short appendix on some analysis bits including some
useful measure theory results.
<li> A couple of new results in existing sections, another version of
the Kontinuitatssatz in section 2.1, prove the existence of
regular points (and hence density) of a subvariety in 6.5,
and prove that the singular
set of a hypervariety is a subvariety in section 6.6.
<li> New font, more readable (shorter lines).
<li> Lots of minor improvements, new exercises, some new figures, fixed errata.

Specific smaller changes:

<li> Move the definition of \((p,q)\)-form and its derivative to section 4.4
  as that's where it's needed first.
<li> Add a note about \(\log \lvert f \rvert\) being harmonic after Theorem 0.1.3
<li> Add equivalent definition of "locally bounded" to the footnote.
<li> In proof of Proposition 1.1.3, emphasize that (1.1) means \(f\) is
  continuous on \(U,\) not just \(\Delta,\) to avoid worrying about
  measurability.  Improve the proof to only use the standard Leibniz rule
  for Riemann integrals.
<li> Add Exercise 1.1.8 on boundedness and extension through a point,
and add relevant note to the corollary of Hartogs figure.
<li> Add a note after Theorem 1.2.1 to note that continuity up to the
  boundary is not really necessary.
<li> Improve the wording of the definition of Reinhardt domain.
<li> Add Exercises 1.2.3 and 1.2.4.  This renumbers the exercises
in 1.2.
<li> Make Exercise 1.2.9 (domain of convergence is a complete Reinhardt
domain) into a proposition (keeping the exercise, but just stating it as a
proposition), that flows better.  It renumbers the following
Theorems/Propositions/Lemmas in 1.2.
<li> After the identity theorem, note the difference with the one variable
  identity theorem, and give a quick example of why it is not so simple.
<li> Exercise 1.2.12 changed to use the unit ball instead of the polydisc.
<li> When introducing the Jacobian put "holomorphic" in parentheses and
  mention that we will not say so explicitly if the mapping is holomorphic.
<li> Add Exercise 1.3.7 (vector-valued maximum principle)
<li>In the proof of Lemma 1.4.7, emphasize where bounded is being used.
<li> In the proof of Theorem 1.5.1, make the plugging into \(f_k\) a bit more
  specific with displayed equations.  Also introduce "higher order terms"
  earlier, and use it in the end instead of making up new names for them.
<li> Note that all Reinhardt domains are circular after
Corollary 1.5.2.
<li> New Exercise 1.5.10.
<li> New Exercises 1.6.1, 1.6.2, 1.6.3, and 1.6.6. 
  Renumbers rest of the exercises in 1.6.
<li> At the end of Example 1.6.3, make the zero set be the same as that for
the first two functions in the example.
<li> Rename 2.1 to "Domains of holomorphic &amp; holomorphic extension"
<li> New Exercises 2.1.4 and 2.1.5, renumbers rest of the exercises in 2.1
<li> New Exercise 2.1.15
<li> New Theorem 2.1.7, the extension version of the continuity principle,
the Kontinuitatssatz.
  Name the two version "first version" and "second version."
<li> Adds Exercises 2.1.16, 2.1.17, and 2.1.18
<li> Remove Exercise 2.2.1 as it's now covered by 2.1.4, and add a
different Exercise 2.2.1 after definition 2.2.2.
<li> After Exercise 2.2.2, after the computation showing that \(X_p f\)
depends only on values on \(M,\) explicitly note what a smooth function
on a nonopen set is. 
<li> Add Proposition 2.2.6 about where tangent spaces are taken.  Renumbers
following propositions, definitions, and examples in 2.2.
<li> Change Lemma 2.2.9 to Proposition to be consistent with 2.3 where the
analogous result is a Proposition.
<li> Add the explicit form of \(T_0 M\) into the statement of Proposition 2.2.9.
<li> Add blurb about translations and matrices preserving
convexity and add Exercise 2.2.8 to prove it, renumbers the rest
of the exercises in 2.2.
<li> Add Exercise 2.2.11
<li> Pull out the definition of the complexified real derivative to the
before the statement of Proposition 2.3.1.
<li> Rename 2.3 to "Holomorphic vectors, Levi form, pseudoconvexity"
<li> Add Exercises 2.3.2 and 2.3.3, renumbers the rest in 2.3.
<li> Make Proposition 2.3.2 be more general, not just for biholomorphisms.
<li> Add a quick remark after Proposition 2.3.3 to notice how the z and w
variables are handled in \(\varphi .\)
<li> In Exercise 2.3.4 ask to show that the new full Hessian matrix is also
  Hermitian.
<li> New Exercises 2.3.5-2.3.7
<li> In 2.3 add a bit more on the relationship of the positivity/eigenvalues of
  of the real and complex Hessians.  (mainly the exercises)
<li> The real Hessian in terms of the \(z\)s and \(\bar{z}\)s has now the block rows
  flipped, that is really the correct way to look at it so that it is
  hermitian.
<li> When saying how does a complex linear change of variables acts on the Hessian,
mention that we mean by the derivative \(D_{\mathbb{C}} A .\)
<li> In the discussion before Theorem 2.3.8, use L instead of H for the
complex Hessian for consistency.
<li> In Exercise 2.3.13, require that the dimension is at least
two, otherwise it is too trivial.
<li> Improve the discussion after Narasimhan's lemma (2.3.10)
<li> Change Exercise 2.3.14 to address an erratum: First show that the \(a\)
and \(b\) matrices can be made symmetric.
<li> In the proof of Theorem 2.3.11, when writing out the analytic discs,
mention that \(\xi\) is in the disc.
<li> After the proof also mention that the proof could be done with those
discs using the first version of the continuity principle (new in this
edition).
<li> Rename 2.4 to "From harmonic to plurisubharmonic functions"
<li> Make Exercise 2.4.11 into a proposition as we
use it without mentioning it much often.  Leave the proof still as an
exercise.  Renumbers rest of the propositions in 2.4.
<li> Move Exercise 2.4.27 up and make it Exercise 2.4.22 as it makes a lot
more sense at that point.  Renumbers the following exercises.
<li> Make the composition of holomorphic and
psh function being psh an explicit corollary as
it is important in the exposition.  Still leave the proof as an exercise.
<li> Clarify the proof of Rad√≥'s theorem.
<li> Start 2.5 with a better introduction to why we consider hulls.
<li> In 2.5, add a footnote about why we won't define convex functions
  on arbitrary domains.
<li> In Exercise 2.5.15, it is much easier to use exercise 2.5.9
  than the "hint" in text, so replace that hint.
<li> In Exercise 2.5.13, require that the disc only goes out of \(U\) at
  the origin, which is really the only reasonable way to do this.
<li>In the proof of Theorem 2.5.8, label the estimates and reword the
proof little bit to make it clearer.
<li> Move Exercise 2.6.13 (Behnke-Stein) past Cartan-Thullen.  It is much
  easier then.
<li> In the proof of Cartan-Thullen, don't use strict inequalities
which aren't needed
<li>In 3.1, when looking at convergence of real power series, use open
product of intervals to start with for consistency.
<li>Example 3.1.8, remove the square, it's not necessary
<li> Be more precise in exercise 4.1.3 to mention that the wanted function
is continuous up to the boundary (so that it has boundary values).
<li>Rename 4.2 to be a bit more descriptive.
<li> Ask a little bit more in 4.2.2, that only the second form allows the differentiation
under the integral.
<li> New part b) to Exercise 5.2.3.
<li> After definition 6.1.3, use A and B for the sets not X and Y, and also
mention set complement for germs.  So ask about complement in Exercise
6.1.7.
<li> Define "unit" in 6.2
<li> Add Figure 6.1 to proof of the Weierstrass preparation theorem.
<li> Reword the proof of Weierstrass preparation theorem somewhat to be
clearer, and add power sum to the index.
<li> Add Figure 6.3 to Exercise 6.2.4 (the square root example).
<li> Mention that the formulas relating the symmetric functions and power
sums are called the Newton identities or Girard-Newton formulas.
<li> After the Weierstrass preparation theorem when we remark it is a generalization of
the implicit function theorem, say it is a k-valued solution rather than
k solutions, as that could be misinterpreted.
<li> Before the Weierstrass division theorem, give the one-variable version
of it.
<li> Add a remark about how the preparation and division theorems are
really theorems about formal power series.
<li> At the beginning of section 6.3, when talking about geometrically
distinct zeros, use \(\zeta\) for the (single) variable instead of \(z_n .\)
<li> In the proof of Proposition 6.3.1, mention that WLOG we are assuming
that \(\alpha(0)=0 .\)
<li> Clarify the proof of Theorem 6.3.3, explicitly write out the argument
principle, use \(\gamma_j\) instead of
\(\gamma'\) as that could be misinterpreted,
and make the figure in the proof
more correct as the curves are picked at \(p'\) not any \(z'.\)
<li> Make the definition of ideal in 6.4 clearer.
<li> Add a quick definition of irreducible just above Theorem 6.4.2
for completeness.  Also state Theorem 6.4.2 for nonunits only as to avoid
having to think of what does it mean for a unit.
<li> Put the definition of radical into the main text rather than as a
footnote for more consistency (and add it to the index).
<li> Use \(V_p(I)\) instead of \(V(I)\) as we are doing the germ notion
and that's more consistent.
<li> Simplify the statement in 6.5.4.
<li> Define the dimension of a subvariety and the concept of pure dimension
using only regular points, that way we get around the technicality
that we never prove that the set of regular points is dense in general.
Also simplifies the last exercise in 6.5.
<li> Move the statement of the theorem about \(Z_f\) to section 6.5 from
6.6 (now Theorem 6.5.9), and add the generalization of this result (that
regular points exist and are thus dense) to arbitrary varieties,
Lemma 6.5.10.
<li>Add the statement about dimension of singularity being less than the
dimension of the variety to Theorem 6.5.11 (which is left without proof).
<li> In 6.6, what is now Theorem 6.6.2 had a gap (must use that
that regular points are dense, so fix this gap).
<li> Reorganize section 6.6, and add a theorem (Theorem 6.6.5) proving that
the singular
set of a hypervariety is a subvariety, makes things more complete at least
for hypervarieties.  Add a figure to go with Theorem 6.6.5 and a couple of
exercises to finish the proof.  Also a figure to the parabola example.
Also one exercise was removed due to an
erratum.  That all renumbers the exercises in the section.
<li> Reword the Local parametrization theorem a little bit and explicitly say
that E is the discriminant set.
<li> Exercise 6.7.9 was missing a conclusion to prove.  Make it into proving
  an if and only if for irreducibility, which is really what was meant.
<li>Add a figure to Example 6.8.2.
<li>In section 6.8, add a figure for the definition of the Segre variety.
<li> In Appendix B, introduce and use winding numbers and describe how things
  are connected to our statements.  That makes things more compatible with
  most one-variable books.
<li> Improve Figure C.1 a little.
<li> In Appendix C add a short note on how to evaluate \(k\)-forms.
<li> In Appendix D define integral domain and properly assume it for the
definitions of PID and UFD.
<li> Add reference to my one variable book in the reading.
<li> When computing the Hessian use the vertical bar to evaluate,
  it may be clearer
<li> Figures now have numbers, captions, float, and have explicit references
  in text.
<li> Replace many j's with k's or similar for aesthetic reasons.  Some other
  letters are changed to be more consistent too.
<li> Use Hermitian form or Hermitian quadratic form where appropriate rather
than sesquilinear which should only be called that if both arguments can vary independently.
<li> Some figures have been mildly cleaned up.
<li> Shorten a couple of section titles slightly.
<li> Tighten the language and improve clarity in many places.
