<li>Add footnote to Exercise 2.2.1 that it works for smooth functions too by
using Taylor's theorem so that the reader doesn't think it is only for
polynomials.
<li>In 4.4, when defining \((p,q)\)-forms,
note that the coefficients are smooth on some open set \(U .\)
<li>In the first sentence defining complex affine subspace, avoid trying to
be cute and short and just give the standard, though slightly longer
definition.  The original had the issue that we really should have said that
\(c\) is in the image of \(M.\)
<li>In 4.6, when describing the relationship of Cousin II to Weierstrass,
add a footnote mentioning that the reason we assume nonvanishing of the
derivative is only for simplicity (we don't know anything about varieties
in chapter 4 yet).
<li>In Example 6.8.3, mention at the beginning that we made \(M\) to
contain the hypersurface \(w=0 .\)
<li>Add "principal part" definition and the Mittag-Leffler theorem to
appendix B, since we do refer to it in the Cousin problems section.
<li>Mention that the cohomology groups from differential forms are
the de Rham cohomology and add that to the index.  Also put the initial
trivial map \(d\) into the complex for completeness.
<li>Add footnote to the sentence introducing Stokes (Theorem C.6) about the
naming.
