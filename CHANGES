Since edition 3

FIXME: Some are WORK IN PROGRESS

<li> New short appendix on the useful measure theory results.
<li> New section 4.4 on the solvability of the d-bar problem in the polydisc.
  (WORK IN PROGRESS)
<li> Move the definition of \((p,q)\)-form and its derivative to section 4.4
  as that's where it's needed first.
<li> New font, more readable (shorter lines)
<li> Add a note about \(\log \lvert f \rvert\) being harmonic after Theorem 0.1.3
<li> Add equivalent definition of "locally bounded" to the footnote.
<li> In proof of Proposition 1.1.3, emphasize that (1.1) means \(f\) is
  continuous on \(U,\) not just \(\Delta,\) to avoid worrying about
  measurability.  Improve the proof to only use the standard Leibniz rule
  for Riemann integrals.
<li> Add Exercise 1.1.8 on boundedness and extension through a point,
and add relevant note to the corollary of Hartogs figure.
<li> Add a note after Theorem 1.2.1 to note that continuity up to the
  boundary is not really necessary.
<li> Improve the wording of the definition of Reinhardt domain.
<li> Make Exercise 1.2.7 (domain of convergence is a complete Reinhardt
domain) into a proposition (keeping the exercise, but just stating it as a
proposition), that flows better.  It renumbers the following
Theorems/Propositions/Lemmas in 1.2.
<li> After the identity theorem, note the difference with the one variable
  identity theorem, and give a quick example of why it is not so simple.
<li> Exercise 1.2.10 changed to use the unit ball instead of the polydisc.
<li> When introducing the Jacobian put "holomorphic" in parentheses and
  mention that we will not say so explicitly if the mapping is holomorphic.
<li> Add Exercise 1.3.7 (vector-valued maximum principle)
<li>In the proof of Lemma 1.4.7, emphasize where bounded is being used.
<li> In the proof of Theorem 1.5.1, make the plugging into \(f_k\) a bit more
  specific with displayed equations.  Also introduce "higher order terms"
  earlier, and use it in the end instead of making up new names for them.
<li> Note that all Reinhardt domains are circular after
Corollary 1.5.2.
<li> New Exercise 1.5.10.
<li> New Exercises 1.6.1, 1.6.2, 1.6.3, and 1.6.6. 
  Renumbers rest of the exercises in 1.6.
<li> At the end of Example 1.6.3, make the zero set be the same as that for
the first two functions in the example.
<li> New Exercises 2.1.4 and 2.1.5, renumbers rest of the exercises in 2.1
<li> New Exercise 2.1.15
<li> New Theorem 2.1.7, the extension version of the continuity principle.
  Name the two version "first version" and "second version."
<li> Adds Exercises 2.1.16, 2.1.17, and 2.1.18
<li> Remove Exercise 2.2.1 as it's now covered by 2.1.4, and add a
different Exercise 2.2.1 after definition 2.2.2.
<li> After Exercise 2.2.2, after the computation showing that \(X_p f\)
depends only on values on \(M,\) explicitly note what a smooth function
on a nonopen set is. 
<li> Add Proposition 2.2.6 about where tangent spaces are taken.  Renumbers
following propositions, definitions, and examples in 2.2.
<li> Change Lemma 2.2.9 to Proposition to be consistent with 2.3 where the
analogous result is a Proposition.
<li> Add the explicit form of \(T_0 M\) into the statement of Proposition 2.2.9.
<li> Add blurb about translations and matrices preserving
convexity and add Exercise 2.2.8 to prove it, renumbers the rest
of the exercises in 2.2.
<li> Add Exercise 2.2.11
<li> Pull out the definition of the complexified real derivative to the
before the statement of Proposition 2.3.1.
<li> Add Exercise 2.3.2, renumbers the rest in 2.3.
<li> Make Proposition 2.3.2 be more general, not just for biholomorphisms.
<li> Add a quick remark after Proposition 2.3.3 to notice how the z and w
variables are handled in \(\varphi .\)
<li> In Exercise 2.3.3 ask to show that the new full Hessian matrix is also
  Hermitian.
<li> New Exercises 2.3.4-2.3.6
<li> In 2.3 add a bit more on the relationship of the positivity/eigenvalues of
  of the real and complex Hessians.  (mainly the exercises)
<li> The real Hessian in terms of the \(z\)s and \(\bar{z}\)s has now the block rows
  flipped, that is really the correct way to look at it so that it is
  hermitian.
<li> When saying how does a complex linear change of variables acts on the Hessian,
mention that we mean by the derivative \(D_{\mathbb{C}} A .\)
<li> In the discussion before Theorem 2.3.8, use L instead of H for the
complex Hessian for consistency.
<li> Rename 2.4 to "From harmonic to plurisubharmonic functions"
<li> In Exercise 2.5.15, it is much easier to use exercise 2.5.9
  than the "hint" in text, so replace that hint.
<li> Move Exercise 2.6.13 (Behnke-Stein) past Cartan-Thullen.  It is much
  easier then.
<li> New part b) to exercise 5.2.3.
<li> Exercise 6.7.9 was missing a conclusion to prove.  Make it into proving
  an if and only if for irreducibility, which is really what was meant.
<li> In appendix B, introduce and use winding numbers and describe how things
  are connected to our statements.  That makes things more compatible with
  most one-variable books.
<li> Improve Figure C.1 a little.
<li> When computing the Hessian use the vertical bar to evaluate,
  it may be clearer
<li> Figures now have numbers, captions, float, and have explicit references
  in text.
<li> Replace many j's with k's or similar for aesthetic reasons.  Some other
  letters are changed to be more consistent too.
<li> Use Hermitian form or Hermitian quadratic form where appropriate rather
than sesquilinear which should only be called that if both arguments can vary independently.
<li> Some figures have been mildly cleaned up.
<li> Shorten a couple of section titles slightly.
<li> Tighten the language and improve clarity in many places.
