<li>In Exercise 1.2.14, clarify parts b and c.  Namely the point is that
we mean infinitely many lines.  In both parts, it is better to just ask for
infinitely many.  No need to bring countability into it.
<li>To fix erratum in Exercise 3.4.4, change hypothesis that \(f\) is
"real-valued" to "nonconstant".
<li>In Exercise 4.1.3 part a), write the derivative with respect to
\(\bar{\zeta}\) as in the
rest of the formulas and make the formula displayed for clarity.
