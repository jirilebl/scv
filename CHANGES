<li>In Exercise 1.2.14, clarify parts b and c.  Namely the point is that
we mean infinitely many lines.  In both parts, it is better to just ask for
infinitely many.  No need to bring countability into it.
<li>To fix erratum in Exercise 3.4.4, change hypothesis that \(f\) is
"real-valued" to "nonconstant".
