<li>In Exercise 1.2.14, clarify parts b and c.  Namely the point is that
we mean infinitely many lines.  In both parts, it is better to just ask for
infinitely many.  No need to bring countability into it.
<li>To fix erratum in Exercise 3.4.4, change hypothesis on \(f\) from
"real-valued" to "nonconstant".
<li>In Exercise 4.1.3 part a), write the derivative with respect to
\(\bar{\zeta}\) as in the
rest of the formulas and make the formula displayed for clarity.
<li>In Exercise 4.4.11, to fix erratum the conclusion was reversed by mistake, so
the point is to show that \(H^{(0,1)}(U) \not= 0 .\)
<li>In Example 4.5.2, use \(U \cap L\) instead of
\(\Delta_{\sqrt{3}}(0)\) as that mixes notations (that's a subset of
\(\mathbb{C}\) not \({\mathbb{C}}^2\)).
<li>In Exercise 4.6.5, the \(f\) to be found should be in \(\mathcal{O}(U)\)
to fix erratum.
<li>In Exercise 5.2.3, add hypothesis that \(f\) is not identically zero to
fix erratum.
