<li>In Exercise 1.2.14, clarify parts b and c.  Namely the point is that
we mean infinitely many lines.  In both parts, it is better to just ask for
infinitely many.  No need to bring countability into it.
<li>Fix the definition of logarithmically convex in 2.6 to only look at the
points in the domain where none of the components are zero to fix an
erratum.
<li>To fix erratum in Exercise 3.4.4, change hypothesis on \(f\) from
"real-valued" to "nonconstant".
<li>In Exercise 4.1.3 part a), write the derivative with respect to
\(\bar{\zeta}\) as in the
rest of the formulas and make the formula displayed for clarity.
<li>In Exercise 4.4.11, to fix erratum the conclusion was reversed by mistake, so
the point is to show that \(H^{(0,1)}(U) \not= 0 .\)
<li>In Example 4.5.2, use \(U \cap L\) instead of
\(\Delta_{\sqrt{3}}(0)\) as that mixes notations (that's a subset of
\(\mathbb{C}\) not \({\mathbb{C}}^2\)).
<li>In Exercise 4.6.5, the \(f\) to be found should be in \(\mathcal{O}(U)\)
to fix erratum.
<li>In Exercise 5.2.3, add hypothesis that \(f\) is not identically zero to
fix erratum.
<li>In Exercise 5.3.1, only ask for "complete orthogonal" not "orthonormal"
to fix erratum.
<li>In proof of Theorem 6.2.3, for consistency, write
\(\frac{\partial f}{\partial z_n}(z',\zeta)\) rather than
\(\frac{\partial f}{\partial \zeta}(z',\zeta) .\)
<li>Be clearer with the definitions of "geometrically distinct" and
geometrically unique" in 6.3.
<li>In Exercise 6.3.1, be more precise using the "geometrically distinct" and
"geometrically unique" terminology so that it is not misread (though the
problem has the same solution if misread).
<li>In Exercise 6.4.2, in the more precise version specify that the ideal is
nonzero to fix erratum.
<li>Allow a linear change of coordinates in Exercise 6.4.4 to fix an
erratum.
<li>In the proof of theorem 6.4.2, argue that the \(P_1,\ldots,P_k\)
are Weierstrass as that is needed in the fixed Exercise 6.4.7 which only
holds for Weierstrass polynomials.
<li>In Example 6.5.6, when we refer to the pictures be more precise
by saying that the plots are of \(C \cap {\mathbb{R}}^2\) and 
\(X \cap {\mathbb{R}}^2 .\)
<li>Slightly rephrase the definition of dimension at a point, Definition
6.5.7.
<li>Slightly reword the proof of Lemma 6.5.10.
<li>In Exercise 6.7.5, use \(\xi\) instead of \(z\) for the parameter.
<li>In Theorem 6.7.6, explicitly state that \(g\) is
\({\mathbb{C}}^{n-1}\)-valued.
<li>Change Exercise 6.7.6 to fix an erratum.
<li>Fix errata in Exercises 6.7.10 and 6.7.11
<li>Fix erratum in Exercise 6.8.4.
<li>In Appendix A, don't write out anything as displayed equations
as the ones that were were kind of random.  This gives us a bit more
room to grow.
