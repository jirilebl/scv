Since edition 3

FIXME: Some are WORK IN PROGRESS

<li> New short appendix on the useful measure theory results.
<li> New section 4.4 on the solvability of the d-bar problem in the polydisc.
  (WORK IN PROGRESS)
<li> Move the definition of \((p,q)\)-form and its derivative to section 4.4
  as that's where it's needed first.
<li> New font, more readable (shorter lines)
<li> Add a note about \(\log \lvert f \rvert\) being harmonic after Theorem 0.1.3
<li> Add equivalent definition of "locally bounded" to the footnote.
<li> In proof of Proposition 1.1.3, emphasize that (1.1) means \(f\) is
  continuous on \(U,\) not just \(\Delta,\) to avoid worrying about
  measurability.  Improve the proof to only use the standard Leibniz rule
  for Riemann integrals.
<li> Add a note after Theorem 1.2.1 to note that continuity up to the
  boundary is not really necessary.
<li> Improve the wording of the definition of Reinhardt domain.
<li> Make Exercise 1.2.7 (domain of convergence is a complete Reinhardt
domain) into a proposition (keeping the exercise, but just stating it as a
proposition), that flows better.  It renumbers the following
Theorems/Propositions/Lemmas in 1.2.
<li> After the identity theorem, note the difference with the one variable
  identity theorem.
<li> Exercise 1.2.10 changed to use the unit ball instead of the polydisc.
<li> New Exercise 1.5.10.
<li> New Exercise 1.6.1, renumbers rest of the exercises in 1.6
<li> New Exercise 2.1.4, renumbers rest of the exercises in 2.1
<li> New Exercise 2.1.14
<li> New Theorem 2.1.7, the extension version of the continuity principle.
  Name the two version "first version" and "second version."
<li> Adds Exercises 2.1.15, 2.1.16, and 2.1.17
<li> In Exercise 2.3.2 ask to show that the new full Hessian matrix is also
  Hermitian.
<li> New Exercises 2.3.3-2.3.5, renumbers the rest in 2.3
<li> New part b) to exercise 5.2.3.
<li> In 2.3 add a bit more on the relationship of the positivity/eigenvalues of
  of the real and complex Hessians.  (mainly the exercises)
<li> The real Hessian in terms of the zs and zbars has now the block rows
  flipped, that is really the correct way to look at it so that it is
  hermitian.
<li> Rename 2.4 to "From harmonic to plurisubharmonic functions"
<li> In Exercise 2.5.15, it is much easier to use exercise 2.5.9
  than the "hint" in text, so replace that hint.
<li> Move Exercise 2.6.13 (Behnke-Stein) past Cartan-Thullen.  It is much
  easier then.
<li> Exercise 6.7.9 was missing a conclusion to prove.  Make it into proving
  an if and only if for irreducibility, which is really what was meant.
<li> In appendix B, introduce and use winding numbers and describe how things
  are connected to our statements.  That makes things more compatible with
  most one-variable books.
<li> Improve Figure C.1 a little.
<li> When computing the Hessian use the vertical bar to evaluate,
  it may be clearer
<li> Figures now have numbers, captions, float, and have explicit references
  in text.
<li> Replace many j's with k's or similar for aesthetic reasons.  Some other
  letters are changed to be more consistent too.
<li> Some figures have been mildly cleaned up.
<li> Shorten a couple of section titles slightly.
<li> Tighten the language in places.
