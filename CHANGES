Since edition 3

* New font, more readable (shorter lines)
* New Exercise 1.5.10.
* New Exercise 1.6.1, renumbers rest of the exercises in 1.6
* New Exercise 2.1.4, renumbers rest of the exercises in 2.1
* New Exercises 2.3.3-2.3.5, renumbers the rest in 2.3
* New part b) to exercise 5.2.3.
* In 2.3 add a bit more on the relationship of the positivity/eigenvalues of
  of the real and complex Hessians.  (mainly the exercises)
* In Exercise 2.5.15, it is much easier to use exercise 2.5.9
  than the "hint" in text, so replace that hint.
* Move Exercise 2.6.13 (Behnke--Stein) past Cartan--Thullen.  It is much
  easier then.
* Figures now have numbers, captions, float, and have explicit references
  in text.
* When computing the Hessian use the vertical bar to evaluate,
  it may be clearer
* Shorten a couple of section titles slightly
